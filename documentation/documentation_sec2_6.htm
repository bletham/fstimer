<h3>Section 2.6 - Creating a new project</h3><br>

Now that we have explored the basic workings of fsTimer with the fstimer_demo project, we will briefly cover making a new project. This will generally be the first step to preparing to time a race.<br><br>

<img width="355" height="250" src="documentation_figs/fstimer_fig18.png"><br><br> <!--444x313-->

First you will choose a name for the project. As it says, only letters, numbers, and underscore may be used in the project name. This will create a subdirectory in the fsTimer directory using the project name. That is, if the project name is project_name, it will create the directory fstimer/project_name. All of the files generated by fsTimer will be saved in that project directory.<br><br>

Next the project type is specified. As it says on the window, there are two project types: standard and handicap. A standard race is one where all racers have the same start time. In a handicap race each racer specifies a handicap, which is an amount of time that they will start later than the start time. Thus different racers can have different start times, but fsTimer will automatically subtract out their handicap when computing finishing times. For either race type, it is possible to have a race with multiple timed laps.<br><br>

The next thing to be specified are the registration fields. These are exactly the fields that will show up in the "Registration" window. Name, ID (bib number), age, and gender are required. If it is a handicap race then Handicap is required. Anything else is optional. New fields can be added as either an entrybox, meaning a box into which any information can be typed (like for name), or a combobox where one of a few options must be selected (like for gender).<br><br>

<img width="420" height="275" src="documentation_figs/fstimer_fig20.png"><br><br> <!--525x344-->

Recall the "Add family" (member) button in the Registration window. Basically this button performs the same task as the "New" button (creates a new registration database entry), however it pre-fills some of the fields, for instance so that you don't have to keep typing the address for a list of people that are all in the same family. In this window, you can specify for your project which fields should be cleared. Generally first name, ID, age, and gender will be cleared as these are not shared by family members.<br><br>

<img width="642" height="421" src="documentation_figs/fstimer_fig21.png"><br><br> <!--802x526-->

When you press the "Print" button from the Timing window, fsTimer will automatically generate two nicely formatted sets of results: overall results listing everyone, and automatically generated divisional results. This is the window in fsTimer where you can specify what the divisions should be for generating the divisional results. You should coordinate with the race director what divisions they want (for instance, it may depend on how many medals they want to buy).<br><br>

You specify the division name, and what the parameters for the division should be. The parameters can be a range of ages, and/or a collection of combobox values.<br><br>

And that's all there is to starting a new fsTimer project!<br><br>
